Repository containing problems solved using Genetic Algorithms.

### Assignment

Develop a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the following problem:
Given a list of n distinct positive integers, partition the list into two sublists, each of size n/2, such that the difference between the sums of the integers in the two sublists is minimized. 
To obtain your initial list, use a linear congruential random number generator to generate 100 random integers between 1 and 10,000. You will need to do some preprocessing to ensure that these 100 integers are indeed distinct.

Convergence of your algorithm will hinge upon two factors: 

* Population size
* Mutation rate

Experiment with various values of these two parameters and report upon your results. Also, comment on the heuristic that your GA appears to be using.
